# embedding example
# https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nlp/word_embeddings_tutorial.html
# create an embedding table of 3 tensors/vectors of size 3 dims, 3 by 3
embedding = nn.Embedding(3, 3)
# look up the embedding table by indices
print(embedding(torch.IntTensor([0, 1, 1])))
# tensor([[ 1.3636, -0.3836,  0.8032],
#        [-0.1007,  0.9970,  0.2903],
#        [-0.1007,  0.9970,  0.2903]], grad_fn=<EmbeddingBackward0>)
# notice the indices passed should be in the range of the first dim of the embedding table
# if embedding table is (65, 65), then the output of an indices tensor would be (64, 64)
# but what do those values mean?
# each token gets a 65 dimension vector, the values encode some attributes of the token
# which we don't really know. If 2 tokens are have similar values in say dim/col 3, then
# we can say that they are somehow related by attribute represented by dim/col 3.
# but why 65?
# because we want to encode each token's relationship with every other token and there are 65 tokens
# suppose we have an embedding table like this
# up to 10 indices (token vocab size) and 2 dims
embedding = nn.Embedding(10, 2)
# look up the embedding table by indices
print("e2", embedding(torch.IntTensor([0, 4, 9])))
# we get
# e2 tensor([[-0.7861,  0.1931],
#        [ 0.1851,  0.0749],
#        [-1.2250, -0.2263]], grad_fn=<EmbeddingBackward0>)
# this is not a rich embedding because there are only 2 relationships encoded
# but we could have picked 100 dims, which is >> than the vocab size of 10 (in this example)
# maybe it is too much given that there are only 10 possible tokens?
# the pytorch article says " In NLP, it is almost always the case that your features are words"
# so if there are 10 possible words/tokens then 10 dim embedding?
# "We often want dense outputs from our neural networks, where the inputs are âˆ£V| dimensional,
# where V is our vocabulary"
# another hint is that we want dense outputs, so 100 dims for a vocab size would be a sparse vector
# "but often the outputs are only a few dimensional (if we are only predicting a handful of labels,
# for instance). How do we get from a massive dimensional space to a smaller dimensional space"
# interestingly we are not trying to reduce the dimensions with vocabsize 65...
# this could be because of the fact it is only 65, so no need to reduce the embedding dims
# "central to the idea of deep learning is that the neural network learns representations of the
# features, rather than requiring the programmer to design them herself. So why not just let the
# word embeddings be parameters in our model, and then be updated during training?"
# so initially the values are a bit random
# but the values of the embeddings will be updated during training
